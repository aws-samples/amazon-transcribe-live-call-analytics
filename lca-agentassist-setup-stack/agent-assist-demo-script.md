# LCA AGENTASSIST Demo

***
### Part 1: AgentAssist gathers some information for later use - eg credit card type and caller’s first name.       
***

**Agent**: Hello! Thanks for calling ACME Bank. My name is Oliver. How can i help you?  
**Caller**: Hi. I’m calling about my Rewards card.   
**Agent**: Excellent.. give me a second to look up your customer account..    
  
<span style="color:blue">**AGENTASSIST**:  Ask caller to state their first name only, for verification purposes. It should be ‘Bob’ per callerId lookup.</span>  
   
**Agent**: For verification purposes, can you please state your first name?  
**Caller**: My first name is Bob.   
**Agent**: one moment while we verify* that your name matches our records.*    

<span style="color:blue">**AGENTASSIST**: Suggested response: “Perfect! Hi Bob. How can i help you with your rewards-card?”</span> 

**Agent**:  It matches - perfect! Hi Bob. How can i help you with your rewards-card?*

***
### Part 2: AgentAssist retrieves information using the information gathered earlier (eg card type).. in this case by using conditional answer in QnAbot, but other mechanisms -  such as Kendra redirect query filters or custom logic with Lambda hooks - could also be used.
***

**Caller**: I was wondering, what is the cash back rate for this card?  
**Agent**:  I’m looking that up for you now. It won’t take long.   

<span style="color:blue">**AGENTASSIST**: Suggested response: Yes, I see here that the rewards card has a 2% cashback rate on your everyday spending. Did that answer your question? Anything else I can help with today?</span>
  
**Agent**: Yes, I see here that the rewards card has a 2% cashback rate on your everyday spending. Did that answer your question? Anything else I can help with today?  

***
### Part 3: AgentAssist can guide agent through an online transaction, prompting agent to collect the needed information. Potentially AgentAssist could fully automate transaction fulfillment.
***

**Caller**: Thanks, yes. Can i pay my card bill now while I’m on the phone?  
**Agent**:  Yes, absolutely, we can process your payment over the phone. Give me a second to set that up.   

<span style="color:blue">**AGENTASSIST**: Ask caller for last 4 digits of card number</span>
  
**Agent**: Can you please confirm the last 4 digits of your card number?  
**Caller**: Yes. It’s 1234  
**Agent**:  Got it - 1234.    
  
<span style="color:blue">**AGENTASSIST**: Confirm card balance (eg $75.34). Ask caller how much they want to pay ($50 minimum)</span>

**Caller**: I’ll pay $50  
**Agent**:  OK, I’m entering payment for $50.   
  
<span style="color:blue">**AGENTASSIST**: Ask caller if they want to pay from their checking or savings account</span>
  
**Agent**: Which account do you want to pay that from.. Your Savings account, or your Checking account?  
**Caller**: My checking account.  
**Agent**:  Your checking account - perfect. One moment please.    
  
<span style="color:blue">**AGENTASSIST**: All information captured.. Last 4 = 1234, Amount = $50, Account = Checking</span>
  
**Agent**: Great, so I’ve processed payment of $50 from your Checking account.  Is there anything else I can help you with?

### Part 4: Caller asks a question where we have an Kendra FAQ answer in QnABot
***

**Caller**: Can you tell me what kinds of life insurance policies you have?   
**Agent**:  Yes, of course. I’m just pulling up our latest life insurance policy information now.   
  
<span style="color:blue">**AGENTASSIST**: Open https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_insurance: We offer many types of Term life insurance, and Permanent life insurance, including Whole life, Universal life, Endowment policies, Accidental death policies, and more.</span>
  
**Agent**: We offer many types of Term life insurance, and Permanent life insurance, including Whole life, Universal life, Endowment policies, Accidental death policies, and more.

### Part 5: Caller asks a question for which we don’t have an FAQ.. Demonstrates fallback to a Kendra query on unstructured docs from the index (in the case the crawled website)
***

**Caller**: Interesting. What is an endowment policy?  
**Agent**: I'll tell you in one second!   
  
<span style="color:blue">**AGENTASSIST**: Amazon Kendra suggestions. If the cash value grows over time, the death benefits do too. If the cash value declines, the death benefit also declines. Option B policies normally feature higher premiums than option A policies. Endowments[edit] Main article: Endowment policy The endowment policy is a life insurance contract designed to pay a lump sum after a specific term (on its 'maturity') or on death. Typical maturities are ten, fifteen or twenty years up to a certain age limit.
